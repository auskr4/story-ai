Create a compelling science fiction story based on the following information:

Setting: ${answers.setting}
Character's Technological Ability: ${answers.ability}
Scientific Discovery: ${answers.discovery}
Character's Fear: ${answers.fear}

Story Structure Guidelines:

- Rising Action: Complexity increases as the science/tech implications expand
- Climax: Character must use their ability in an unexpected way
- Resolution: Show how the event changes the character's world/understanding

Technology Level Guidelines:
- All technology should feel consistent with the character's described abilities
- Focus on one main technological concept (the character's ability) and build related tech around it
- Keep advanced tech focused on the plot rather than overwhelming the story

Writing Style:
- Vivid descriptions of futuristic technology and environments
- Balance technical descriptions with human emotion and character development
- Use sensory details to bring the science fiction world to life
- Create a cohesive, plausible future world, even if the technology is advanced
